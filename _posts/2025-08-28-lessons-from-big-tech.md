title: Lessons From Big Tech
categories: [Career, Computer Science]

For the past two summers, I've had the privilege of interning in big tech: first at
Apple over summer 2024, then at LinkedIn over summer 2025 (both were software
engineering internships). These experiences came with many lessons learned, and I'd
like to share with you my top three.

## 1. Java is still king

If you were to pick a random university student studying computer science and ask
them to build a simple HTTP server, chances are they'll reach for a Python library,
like Flask or FastAPI, or something in the JavaScript ecosystem, like express.
Nerdier students may choose Rust or Go. This is in great contrast to the tech used
at many big tech companies, which is entirely Java-based. Apple is a Java shop all
the way through, and LinkedIn even uses a custom-built Java REST framework (Rest.li).

As such, the lesson here is to get good at Java. This honestly aligns very well with
my university's computer science curriculum, which is Java-heavy. I've often heard
classmates complain about how Java is "boring" or "outdated", and TBH, I used to do
that too. But given what I know now, I'll probably start telling these classmates to
suck it up for the sake of their careers.

Don't get me wrong, there's a ton of value in exploring new frameworks and modern
languages. However, it's equally valuable to sharpen the skills that will keep you
employed. From my experience, Java is one of those skills. Sure, Java isnâ€™t without its
downsides - verbose syntax, slow startup times, and hefty memory usage are all valid
criticisms. But for big tech companies, it's good enough, and it's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

## 2. Communication is as important as coding ability

It's a common misconception that having good "hands" (coding ability) is enough to
succeed in a software engineering role. This couldn't be further from the truth. Solo
projects that you work on in classes or in your free time may not require communicating
with others, but communication skills are absolutely necessary in big tech. This is
obvious even from the interview processes for these companies, as they almost all
consist of both behavioral and technical rounds.

Most big tech companies operate as independent, self-serving ecosystems with their own
robust internal tools, which might not all be thoroughly documented. If you're used to
relying on Google to get your answers, you may be shocked at how little Googling helps
in a big tech environment. A good chunk of knowledge in big tech companies exists only
in the minds of people who work there and in private Slack DMs. Even if you use an
internal search engine, there's a chance you'll never find what you need to solve a
problem you are having.

While internal search engines and docs are a good first stop, you should always be
ready and willing to ask a teammate for help - it could save you hours of time. On the
flip side, do your due diligence to document what you're working on thoroughly, and
always consider what someone may need to know if they need to pick up your work later.
Don't become part of the problem!

Aside from asking for help, being a good communicator is also necessary for simply
keeping your team in the loop with your work. If you shelter yourself and code all day
without saying anything, there's a chance nobody will know or care about what you're
working on. A few short Slack messages can go a long way when it comes to getting eyes
on your work.

## 3. Ownership and initiative get you far

As an intern, there's hardly any expectation for you to perform at the
level of your more senior teammates. This makes it easy to coast and wait for others to
tell you what to do. In big tech, this not enough to stand out amongst your peers, even
if you complete everything assigned to you.

You may be thinking: well, how _do_ you stand out?

I believe the two most important factors for standing out are ownership and
initiative.

Having ownership over something demonstrates that you are capable of leading a project.
This doesn't mean you have to do it alone - seniors hardly do it alone either. What's
important here is being a reliable point of contact of what you own. You should be well
informed, enough so that you are able to onboard teammates onto the project if
necessary. This helps you stand out by granting you visiblity you may not otherwise
have and gaining trust from your teammates if you do a solid job.

Taking initiative is great for expanding your reach as an intern. When you're working
on a shared codebase, you may run into old bugs or tech debt. Flagging down these issues
and their code owners can give you an opportunity to work on something outside of your
immediate project, which give people outside your team a reason to get to know you. Like
having ownership, this also gives you better visibility, and may even improve your
team's reputation among other teams. The only consequence with this is that taking _too_
much initiative with side tasks may set you behind on your primary project, so finding
balance between the two is important.
