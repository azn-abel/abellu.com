title: Stop Slacking and Build Your Personal Website
categories: [Web Development, Computer Science]

Youâ€™ve probably thought about building a personal website at least once. Maybe you've even started one, only to let it rot in a dusty GitHub repo.

Itâ€™s time to stop slacking.

If you're new to web development, it might feel like a daunting task. If you're a perfectionist, your decision paralysis can leave
you stuck procrastinating. But here's the thing: your website doesnâ€™t need to win design awards. It just needs to convince people youâ€™re
serious about this whole Computer Science thing.

If you're reading this, you've probably come with some questions. Lucky for you, I'm here to answer some of them.

## What if I don't know anything about web development?

If I could go back to when I knew nothing about web development, I would start with the three essentials:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” although a simple site might only require the first two.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-html-and-css) is a solid place to get started.

That said, tutorials will only take you so far. What's much more important is learning how to find answers on your own.
If you don't know how to do something off the top of your head, Google it. Consulting LLMs is an option, but if you want
to truly understand the code you're writing, do so with [caution](https://cameron.rs/blog/dont-outsource-your-soul/).

Anyway, that's the advice I'd give to someone new. As for what I actually did? I dove straight into [React](https://react.dev/).


## What should I use to build my personal website?

So you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well enough to get by. However, in your search for the right tool to
build your website, you've likely come across [dozens](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) of
frontend frameworks you could use. To make matters worse, everyone online is telling you to use something different.

What you choose to use depends on your motivation.

- **Want to be employed?**
  - *Use [React](https://react.dev/)*. It's the [most widely used](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-web-frameworks-and-technologies)
    web technology in the industry, as of 2024.
- **Want to focus on content, not design?**
  - *Use [Astro](https://astro.build/themes/1/?search=&price%5B%5D=free) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io/free)*.
    They have many free themes and templates so you can focus purely on your content.
- **Want to be hip and cool?**
  - *Use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)*
 
The list could go on forever. Heck, you could even just use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your commitment to whatever
you pick matters way more than the framework itself. Choose something that feels right, stick with it, and build your website.
If you ever want to rebuild with different tools later, they will still be there.

## Where can I host my website?

So you have your website built and running on `http://localhost:5173` (or some other port). Congratulations!
You've already come a long way, so give yourself a pat on the back. Now you want your site to be accessible by anyone on the internet.

My go-to is [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). All you need to do to get started with them is create an
account and link your GitHub. From there, you create a Pages deployment, fill out their very short configuration options,
and (about 10 minutes later) boom! Your site is live ðŸ¥³!

Another option I've used in the past is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). However, it's
[quite finicky](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solve-404-when-using-browserrouter-github-pages-anu-shibin-joseph-raj-sx5tf/) to use
with React Router, which I ran into when building my first website.

If you want to use a custom domain, you will need to rent or purchase one from a registrar like
[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). This is its own can of worms, so I won't expand on it here.

## Wrapping it up

Your first personal website probably wonâ€™t be perfect, and it doesnâ€™t have to be. What matters is that you build something and put it out there.
You'll learn more by launching a simple site than by planning the "perfect" one forever.

So stop overthinking it. Pick your tools, write your code, and deploy your site.
